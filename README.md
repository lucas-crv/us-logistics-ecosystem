This project represents a full-scale digital transformation for a logistics enterprise in the United States. I designed and developed an interconnected ecosystem of **6 custom applications** that centralize fragmented shipping data into a single source of truth.

## 🏗 The Architecture (The 6-App Suite)

The challenge was to connect different departments (Warehouse, Drivers, Managers, and Clients). The solution was broken down into specialized modules:

| App | Target User | Key Functionality |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Dispatch Command** | Operations Managers | Real-time load assignment and route optimization. |
| **Driver Hub** | Truck Drivers | Load confirmation, digital BOL (Bill of Lading), and GPS logging. |
| **Warehouse Sync** | Floor Staff | Inventory tracking and loading dock status updates. |
| **Fleet Maintenance** | Mechanics | Vehicle health monitoring and service scheduling. |
| **Client Portal** | Customers | Real-time tracking and delivery confirmation. |
| **Admin Dashboard** | Executives | Power BI integrated analytics for KPI monitoring. |
